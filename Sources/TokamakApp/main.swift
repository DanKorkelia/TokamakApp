                This minimalist app helps you create, secure passwords for your online and app logins in the fastest possible way.

                Passwords Generator doesnâ€™t store your passwords or email them to you via unsecured email transport. It just lets you use them on your device. You can also use it to generate passwords for your other devices using HandOff.

                When you need a good new password, it's hard to get one quick so you settle for old one which makes your valuable data less secure, especially on mobile device. Passwords Generator app helps you get good random password with helpful presets and with quick double tap you can copy it to wherever you need it!
